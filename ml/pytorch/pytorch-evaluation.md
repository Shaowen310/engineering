# PyTorch Evaluation

## Training environment

`model.train()`

Use

`input.requires_grad_()`

to state the variables for gradient calculation explicitly

## Evaluation environment

`model.eval()`

## Disable gradient calculation

`with torch.no_grad():`

But it keeps the previous training environment.
