# Bernoulli trial

**Independent repeated** trials of an experiment with exactly two possible outcomes are called Bernoulli trials. Call one of the outcomes "success" and the other outcome "failure". Let ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?p) be the probability of success in a Bernoulli trial, and ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?q) be the probability of failure. Then ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?p&plus;q%3D1), since these are complementary events: "success" and "failure" are **mutually exclusive** and **exhaustive**.
