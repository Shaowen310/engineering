# Bernoulli trial

**Independent repeated** trials of an experiment with exactly two possible outcomes are called Bernoulli trials. Call one of the outcomes "success" and the other outcome "failure". Let $$p$$ be the probability of success in a Bernoulli trial, and $$q$$ be the probability of failure. Then $$p+q=1$$, since these are complementary events: "success" and "failure" are **mutually exclusive** and **exhaustive**.
