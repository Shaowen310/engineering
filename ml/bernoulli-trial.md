# Bernoulli trial

**Independent repeated** trials of an experiment with exactly two possible outcomes are called Bernoulli trials. Call one of the outcomes "success" and the other outcome "failure". Let ![p](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=p) be the probability of success in a Bernoulli trial, and ![q](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=q) be the probability of failure. Then ![p+q=1](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=p%2Bq%3D1), since these are complementary events: "success" and "failure" are **mutually exclusive** and **exhaustive**.
